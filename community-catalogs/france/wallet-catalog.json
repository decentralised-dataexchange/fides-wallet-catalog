The state-provided digital identity platform generates electronically signed proofs of identity to prevent fraud, authenticates users for FranceConnect government services access, and displays identity cards and Carte Vitale health insurance cards, with plans to expand health card functionality in 2025, positioning France among early adopters of EUDI Wallet-compatible infrastructure preparing for EU Digital Identity Wallet framework implementation by 2030 for uniform mobile driving licenses across Europe aligned with eIDAS 2.0 regulation.",
