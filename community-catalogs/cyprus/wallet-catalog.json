The app requires users to have activated and verified CY Login profiles to access government systems and services along with two-factor authentication enabled, working alongside Cyprus's IDMe.cy digital ID system as the country fulfills eIDAS 2.0 requirements mandating EU member states to offer digital wallet options by 2026.",
